# NAS - Neural Access System

The aim of this work was to create a brain-computer interface that reliably identifies and
verifies a person using his electroencephalographic signals. Creating a user profile and verifying it is based on processing reactions to his own face, and the face of strangers or acquaintances. Algorithms such as bandpass and noise removal using wavelet transformation
are user to filter signals. The classification of reactions is performed using a convolutional
neural network or linear discriminant analysis. The average accuracy of the linear discriminant analysis is 66.2 % and of the convolutional neural network is 58.7 %. The maximum
achieved accuracy was with linear discriminant analysis and at 93.7 %.
